<p>Feature phones are cool. I have always wanted to use a feature phone daily, but my university and my family all rely on smartphone apps for communication. I like the idea of using a feature phone because phones are just tools, not something that enslaves people&#8217;s minds. Yes, smartphones are very useful, but have you ever wondered what the world would be like if we stopped using them?</p>

<p>I became addicted to my phone when I was in high school. I had many social apps, a lot of accounts, and even more games that I never played. I can say that most of my high school time was spent on my phone. I&#8217;m not sure when I decided to uninstall all the apps on my phone and keep only the bare minimum, such as WhatsApp, Telegram, Spotify, Nike Apps (for fitness), and my bank account app. There&#8217;s no point having a lot of apps on your smartphone and spending the whole day just clearing all the notification badges on the homescreen.</p>

<p>For feature phones, what&#8217;s the point? Have you ever heard of a social detox? That&#8217;s what a feature phone can truly help with. Feature phones have limited functions such as making calls, sending SMS, playing music, FM radio, torchlight and other basic things that you would expect them to have. Isn&#8217;t that enough for everyday needs? We don&#8217;t need all the fancy and deluxe things to have the status of being &#8220;involved&#8221;. FOMO happens when a person has no access to the latest information and makes them feel anxious and stressed, and they always want to grab the phone and do the &#8220;refresh&#8221; gesture.</p>

<p>Feature phones are cheap to buy. If your surroundings allow you to do so, try using one for one week. I can guarantee that you will see the difference.</p>
