<h1 id="feature-phone">Feature Phone</h1>

<p>Date: May,17 2022 16:53</p>

<p>Features on phones are cool. I always wanted to daily drive a feature phone, but my university and my family all use smartphone apps to communicate with us. I like the idea of using a feature phone. Phones are a tool, not a tool that enslaves people’s brains. Yes, smartphones are very useful for each one of us, but have you ever wondered what would happen if the world stopped using smartphones? What will it be like?</p>

<p>I got addicted to the phone when I was in high school. I had many social apps installed, a lot of accounts, and a lot of games that I installed, but I didn’t even play them. I can say that most of my high school time was mostly on my phone. I’m not sure when I decided to uninstall the apps on my phone and went with the bare minimum of apps such as WhatsApp, Telegram, Spotify, Nike Apps (for fitness), and my bank account app. There’s no point having a lot of apps inside of the smartphone and spending the whole day just clearing all the notification badges on the homescreen.</p>

<p>Well, for feature phones? What’s the point then? Have you ever heard of social detox? That’s what a feature phone can truly help with. Feature phones have limited functions such as making calls, sending SMS, music, FM radio, torchlight and other basic things that you would expect them to have. Isn’t that enough for everyday needs? We don’t need all those fancy and deluxe things to have the status of being &#8220;involved&#8221;. FOMO happens when a particular person has no access to the latest information and makes them feel anxious and stressed, and they always want to grab the phone and do the &#8220;refresh&#8221; gesture.</p>

<p>Feature phones are cheap to buy. If your surroundings allow you to do so, try it for one week. I can guarantee that you will see the difference.</p>
