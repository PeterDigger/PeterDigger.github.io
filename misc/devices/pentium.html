<h1 id="pentium-g620">Pentium G620</h1>

<p>This desktop essentially wraps up my first half of my high school time. I kept playing games on this machine. This configuration has 4GB RAM. Windows 7 and later upgraded to Windows 8.1. </p>

<p>I played lots of games with it. Games such as GTA SA, Prototype1, 2, Iron Man, Max Payne, City Skyline, Left 4 Dead and etc. I still remember the time when I wanted to go school and I made my school driver wanted me outside my house just waited for me to finish the game and shutdown the system. And most of the time was testing new game settings. </p>

<p>This configuration also undergo replacing new HDD too. Thats when time I stopped play game as the hard disk has failed and corrupted the data in it. After the hard disk was later replaced, it was installed with Windows 8.1. Also my brother-in-law had removed the GPU because he needed it of maybe my mom asked him to remove? Who knows but yea glad it broke the time when I needed to focus. Thanks too. without you broking last time, I wouldn&#8217;t be here typing this in my Uni.  </p>

<p>With it, I also have learned how to use linux and fix my desktop and also brought it to reformat. Through those experience, I have learned how and have interest to fix a computer DIY. And always optimize the hard disk to make sure it runs at the top performance. At one point this desktop had a replacement for PSU too. </p>

<p>After both of my sister got married, the desktop was essentially sat there and do nothing but collects layer of dust. And little to I know, this desktop was later involved into my NAS. Learned about upgrading hardware, firmware and self-hosting too.</p>
